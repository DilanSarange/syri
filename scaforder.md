### Pseudo-genome assembly generation `scaffoldOrder`
SyRI can be used to generate reference guided pseudo-genomes (pseudo-chromosomal assemblies) to analyse genomes for which chromosome level assemblies are not available. Incomplete assembly is aligned to the reference genomes and the alignment information allows anchoring of scaffolds to get pseudo-chromosomes. Though, highly useful, this may result in higher false negatives, as being reference guided some variation will be subdued.


```bash
#Steps:
nucmer --maxmatch -c 1000 -l 100 --noextend -p scaf refgenome qrygenome;
delta-filter -m -i 90 -l 100 scaf.delta > scaf_m_i90_l100.delta; 
show-coords -THrd scaf_m_i90_l100.delta > scaf_m_i90_l100.coords;
cat scaf_m_i90_l100.coords | cut -f10 | uniq | xargs -n 1 -I chr mummerplot -f -l -r chr -p chr scaf_m_i90_l100.delta;
scaffoldOrder qrygenome scaf_m_i90_l100.coords;
```

scaffoldorder will then use large and uniquely identifying scaffolds to generate pseudo-genome and will use the gnuplots (.gp) files generated by mummerplot to get orientiation information.
