## NOTE: IDEALLY, SYRI EXPECTS THAT THE HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES IN THE TWO GENOMES
## WOULD HAVE EXACTLY SAME CHROMOSOME ID. THEREFORE, IT IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED THAT
## THE USER PRE-PROCESSES THE FASTA FILES TO ENSURE THAT HOMOLOGOUS CHROMOSOMES
## HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME ID IN BOTH FASTA FILES CORRESPONDING TO THE TWO GENOMES.
## IN CASE, THAT IS NOT THE CASE, SYRI WOULD TRY TO FIND HOMOLOGOUS GENOMES USING
## WHOLE GENOME ALIGNMENTS, BUT THAT METHOD IS HEURISTICAL AND CAN RESULT IN 
## SUBOPTIMAL RESULTS.
## ADDITIONALLY, THE TWO GENOMES (FASTA FILES) SHOULD HAVE SAME NUMBER OF GENOMES.

## Perform whole genome alignment
